# Assignment9
*The goal of this assignment is to Create a simple Todo angular application using the REST APIs.
* This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.19.
* As a user, I should be able to see all todo items fetched using a REST API.
* As a user, I should be able to click a todo item and able to see its detailed view.
* As a user, I should be able to open add a new todo item view by clicking the add button.
* As a user, I should be able to add a todo item by entering the title, description, due date and time.
* As a user, I should be able to mark a todo item as complete.

## Technical Requirements
* Use angular HTTP client module to fetch data from the Nodejs server.
* Use angular component and data binding features.
* Use SCSS for CSS.
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
